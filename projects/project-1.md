For my EE296 project I worked with other engineering students to explore the possible uses of TEGs (thermoelectric generators). The TEGs used were small square devices about the size of 2-3in. X 2-3in. By applying the TEG to the skin we are able to get a voltage reading. Using this, the goal we decided on was to find possible ways that it can either take temperature or produce enough voltage to become self-sustainable to become implemented into a general purpose “smart-watch”. After further testing, while it could not receive enough voltage to become sustainable we were able to find a constant trend between body temperature and the voltage taken, visible only after a certain time passes. 

In this project I was responsible for a few roles. The first was being one of the test subjects. Using multiple test subjects within our group we were able to find unknown variables in tests between different people and figure out ways to compensate. I also had the role of assisting in the data collection in analysis while testing the other group members. 

Through the TEG project I was able to not only learn about the research process but more importantly working in a team. While working with my group it was easy to open up about my ideas and not hesitate about asking questions when I’m behind, and also support my other group members when they needed to be brought to the same page as well to ensure a successful research project.
