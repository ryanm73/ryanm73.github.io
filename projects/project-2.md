The bcd to seven segment display was a project in EE260L that used k-maps and a decoder to create signals that would display letters A-G on a seven segment LED display, which looks like a digital clock just with one digit. K-maps import the logic from truth tables and are used to create simplified boolean expressions which are then reduced then built onto the breadboard using AND/OR gates for each expression.

During this lab we worked in pairs. I was responsible for building the circuit. This was probably the most tedious part of the project because one mistake out of the dozens of possible mistakes would create a huge time sink, because it would require double-checking each wire connection. I also helped look over the k-maps to reduced boolean expressions to make sure we had the right design plans.

Through this lab I learned the importance of being precise, and when I’m working on one task, that I shut out all the “noise” from other tasks. When building the circuit with dozens of wires dangling around, it can be hard to keep track of things if focus is lost. By carefully going through each boolean expression one-by-one I was able to properly wire each connection without getting distracted by all the wires on the side.
