<h1>Looking Back</h1>
Software engineering has been one of the most fun classes I have taken. Not only was I able to learn great skills like working with javascript and HTML/CSS, but also understand concepts fundamental to software engineering, such as coding standards and ethics in software engineering. 

<h1>Coding Standards</h1>
During our time in software engineering, we were familiarized with Coding Standards. Coding Standards are a set of rules or practices that format the code in a high-quality. 
<br>
<br>
During this class, we were using <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> to make sure our javascript adhered to certain style guidelines. To put it in simple words, it acted as a grammar check for our code. It let us improve the quality of our code, which really helped when working in a group project where clarity and readability is important. 
<br>
<br>
This can be translated outside this class, by prioritizing the same things like quality and clarity, when doing other group work besides coding.

<h1>Ethics in Software Engineering</h1>
Ethics in software engineering is important for any professional. When dealing with anything ethics related, software engineers can use the <a href="">ACM Code of Ethics</a>. It should be noted that the ACM code of ethics does not determine what we should do, simply act as guidelines to aid or help us in making critical moral decisions. 
<br>
<br>
Outside of web development, there are important takeaways. When working in a professional environment, every decision you make could make an impact on the well-being of another person. Being able to think about these things and take them into account will allow work to be done in an ethically sound matter. 

<h1>Moving Forward</h1>
By being able to apply the different concepts I learned in software engineering inside and outside of programming, I think I'll not only become an overall better software engineer but grow as a person as well.
