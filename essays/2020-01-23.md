Programming has never felt like another check on the homework list for me. It was nice to have classes and assignments where I had the freedom to express myself. Having the luxury of being able to map out all of my thoughts in code has always struck something unique with me. 

I hope to one day develop things with not only the programming skills in my mind but the skills I've learned in life as well. I think with  a wide toolkit and the right mindset I can develop great things that others can appreciate and enjoy, but I'm not there yet. I've yet to develop any major projects that I want to show off, or developed anything that would help others. I hope to change that within the next few months. 

In Software Engineering I hope to start paving the way and take another step towards that dream. While programming right now feels like something I can relax while I work on, I know that if I want to reach my goals I need to get out of my comfort zone and really make the push to improve my skils. I want to expand my toolkit further and further, so I can reach higher and solidify myself as a developer in the future.
