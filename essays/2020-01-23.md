Programming has never felt like another check on the homework list for me. It was nice to have classes and assignments where I had the freedom to express myself. Having the luxury of being able to map out all of my thoughts in code has always struck something unique with me. 

I hope to one day develop things with not only the programming skills in my mind but the skills I've learned in life as well, to offer software that others can appreciate and enjoy. 

In Software Engineering I hope to start paving the way and take another step towards that dream. I want to expand my toolkit further and further, so I can reach higher and solidify myself as a developer in the future.
