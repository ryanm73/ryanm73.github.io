During my 3 years of studying, I haven't even learned what coding standards was until just recently, with ESLint. While it didn't really breathe magic into my programming, it helped me clean it up a little bit and even learn more about it while I was coding. Usually yellow marks would mark my minor mistakes and I would be able to catch and reflect on them. Even if the code still functioned, it still showed that there was room for improvement quality-wise. Red marks were more straight forward with their messages, saying there was a mistake here and often times it would explain why. It didn't really feel like forgetting a space between my closed parentheses and curly brackets was a big deal, but it would've been something I would've easily overlooked if I didn't learn about ESLint.

Therefore, I think that coding standards can help you learn a programming language by serving as an aid. While it won't teach you how to program it will catch any small mistakes you make or help you improve the quality of your code. The green checkmark has helped me learn a little more about javascript even if some of the mistakes are trivial.
