<h2>Project: UH Green</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The problem: Over the course of the semester paper students pile up a large number of unused paper in the forms of returned homework, handouts, and essays. This paper, along with other things like empty plastic bottles, are often disposed of in the trash bin, when the items can be recycled. Currently there is no way to easily locate recycle bins and properly toss out recyclables.

The solution: UH Green will be a website that holds that will give the exact locations of any recycle bins nearby.

<h2>Mockup page ideas</h2>
The landing page will explain the purpose of UH Green and why recycling is important. To proceed, a UH login is required. After logging in and receiving a location from the user, it will then show the locations of any recycle bins nearby. If there are no recycle bins within 3 minutes of walking distance, a request to add a recycle bin can be made. Admins will be able to manually add recycle bin locations and review any requests to add any recycle bins to the campus.

<h2>Use case ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>User decides they are carrying too many old handouts. </li>
<li>They login to UH Green and enter their location.</li>
<li>If none are close, a request to add a recycle bin is made.</li>
<li>Admins can review these requests and contact faculty to add a recycle bin.</li>
<li>Admin manually adds location of each recycle bin on campus to UH Green.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Beyond the Basics</h2>
-Two ways to input location: By building or by phone GPS.
