During our first week of web design, we were designing pages using raw HTML/CSS. This left a lot to be desired, with styling being a huge pain to do, our pages would be lacking greatly in the aesthetics department. 

Working with Semantic UI has been a huge upgrade from using just HTML/CSS. We were able to nearly replicate any web page of our choice in the E36 "Your Choice" module. My favorite part about Semantic UI was how we could use menus and grids to format navigation bars and columns. While working on my E36, I was able to find that while columns are even by default, you can easily change the ratio between each column by defining certain columns as "____ wide". 

It can be really time-consuming to learn Semantic UI, but that time is easily made up when formatting becomes way easier using the different Semantic classes. While it won't replace solid HTML/CSS fundamentals, it is an amazing aid for web design.
